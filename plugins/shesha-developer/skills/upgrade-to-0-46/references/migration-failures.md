# Start-up and Migration Failures

Phase 4. This is where the upgrade is actually tested, and where the hard problems live.

## §1. The rule that explains nearly all of it

**FluentMigrator applies any migration absent from `VersionInfo` in ascending order, regardless of how far ahead the database already is.**

So a migration written in 2024 runs today against a 2026 schema. Version numbers guarantee ordering only within one linear history. They guarantee nothing once:

- two release branches each contribute migrations, or
- a module is installed onto a database that is already past its migrations.

Every failure in this file is an instance of that. The shape is always: *a migration asserts a schema state it is not entitled to assume.*

## §2. Diagnose the database before the code

### Is `VersionInfo` real, or backfilled?

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS rows, COUNT(DISTINCT CAST(AppliedOn AS date)) AS days FROM VersionInfo;
SELECT TOP 3 CAST(AppliedOn AS date), COUNT(*) FROM VersionInfo GROUP BY CAST(AppliedOn AS date) ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;
```

A few hundred rows stamped on one or two days means the history was **written in bulk, not earned** — typically a bacpac whose `VersionInfo` came along with it. Such a database can be missing schema its `VersionInfo` claims exists, and is a poor witness for upgrade testing. Genuine incremental execution shows dozens to hundreds of distinct days.

Check a specific migration:
```sql
SELECT AppliedOn FROM VersionInfo WHERE Version = {version};
```
A 2023 migration stamped 2026 never ran here — whatever it creates may simply not exist, however unconditional its code looks.

### Do not trust `column_id` gaps

A gap normally proves a column was dropped in place. **bacpac import renumbers ordinals contiguously**, destroying the evidence — a database that definitely dropped a column can show no gap. Verify the hypothesis another way, or say it is unknown.

## §3. `Invalid column name 'DefaultPriorityLkp'`

The framework failure to expect on an upgraded database.

`M20250623120199` copies `Core_NotificationChannelConfigs` into `frwk.notification_channel_revisions`, selecting `DefaultPriorityLkp`. On `releases/0.43`, `M20260614111200` (PR shesha-io/shesha-framework#5025) *moves* that column onto `Core_NotificationTypeConfigs` and drops it from the channel table. It was never forward-ported, so 0.46 still reads a column the 0.43 line has removed.

Version ordering does not protect you: `20250623120199` is the **lower** number and is meant to run first, while the column still existed — but databases fed from 0.43 applied the higher-numbered migration first and have yet to run the lower-numbered one.

```sql
-- local unblock; re-run after any database re-import
IF OBJECT_ID('Core_NotificationChannelConfigs') IS NOT NULL
   AND COL_LENGTH('Core_NotificationChannelConfigs','DefaultPriorityLkp') IS NULL
    ALTER TABLE Core_NotificationChannelConfigs ADD DefaultPriorityLkp BIGINT NULL;
```

Nothing is lost by the column being NULL: the two tables share no relating column, so the "move" carries no per-row data across.

**Diagnostic that settles it**, if you need to prove the correlation across several databases:

```sql
SELECT CASE WHEN EXISTS(SELECT 1 FROM VersionInfo WHERE Version=20260614111200)
            THEN 'applied' ELSE 'pending' END,
       CASE WHEN COL_LENGTH('Core_NotificationChannelConfigs','DefaultPriorityLkp') IS NULL
            THEN 'MISSING' ELSE 'present' END;
```

Every database that applied the move is missing the column; every one that has not still has it. Databases where the legacy table is already dropped pass regardless, because the script's *table* guard skips them.

## §4. Guard in C#, never in SQL

The single most transferable rule here.

```csharp
// WRONG - the batch is compiled before the IF is evaluated
Execute.Sql("IF COL_LENGTH('t','c') IS NOT NULL BEGIN UPDATE t SET ... ; ALTER TABLE t DROP COLUMN c; END");

// RIGHT
if (Schema.Table("t").Column("c").Exists()) { Execute.Sql("..."); }
```

SQL Server's **deferred name resolution covers tables, not columns of an existing table**. A column reference in a static statement is resolved at compile time even in a branch that is never taken, so the batch fails with `Invalid column name` regardless of the guard.

PL/pgSQL parses statements lazily, so the *same pattern works on PostgreSQL* — which is exactly why it survives review. Code that is correct on one provider and fatal on another is worse than code that is uniformly wrong. Put the check in C#, where it behaves identically on both.

If you must guard inside SQL Server SQL, build the statement as **dynamic SQL** (`sp_executesql`) so the column name only appears in the text when it exists. On PostgreSQL, `to_jsonb(t) ->> 'Column'` reads a possibly-absent column without naming it — it yields NULL for a missing key and never fails to parse.

## §5. Installing a module replays its whole history

Adding a module package puts **all** of its migrations into the candidate set at once, and they run against today's schema. A module that was never installed has none of its migrations in `VersionInfo`, so there is nothing to skip — they are simply absent, and appear the moment the package is referenced.

Expect historical migrations to fail on renamed tables. The Configuration Items rewrite moved `Frwk_ConfigurationItems`, `Frwk_ReferenceLists` and `Frwk_Modules` to `frwk.*`, and `Shesha.FluentMigrator 0.46.0`'s own reference-list helpers still emit the **pre-rename** names — so `this.Shesha().ReferenceListCreate(...)` fails on any post-rewrite database. That affects every module with reflist migrations, not one application.

Weigh the cost before adding a module to satisfy a single migration: you may trade one error for a chain of them.

## §6. Skipping a migration safely

Last resort, and per-database.

```sql
INSERT INTO VersionInfo (Version, AppliedOn, Description)
VALUES ({version}, GETUTCDATE(), 'M{version} (skipped locally: {reason})');
```

**Key rules:**
- **Read the migration first.** Most do several things; skipping the whole thing to dodge one broken statement silently drops the rest. A migration that also adds columns will leave entities mapping to columns that do not exist.
- Never blanket-skip a module's migrations — you will skip the table creation you needed.
- Prefer *making the migration runnable* over skipping it. Adding a missing column so a batch compiles lets the migration execute and reach its intended end state, which beats a `VersionInfo` row that hides unfinished work.
- Always write the reason into `Description`. An unexplained row is indistinguishable from a real one later.
- Raise a ticket. A skipped migration is a database that no longer matches its own history.

## §7. Escalating upstream

These are framework defects, not application bugs. When reporting:

- Give the **root cause**, not the symptom — which branch has the migration, which does not, and which is missing the forward-port.
- Name the **reproduction condition** ("a database fed from the 0.43 line"), not your own database, which may be backfilled and invites "cannot reproduce".
- Recommend **forward-porting over re-implementing**. A cherry-pick keeps the version number, so `VersionInfo` dedupes and databases from either line converge. A re-implementation creates a second version number that *will* meet a database that already did the work — the direct cause of this class of failure.
- Where a migration must tolerate an absent column or table, ask for the **C# guard**, not an in-SQL one (§4).
